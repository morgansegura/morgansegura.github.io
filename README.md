* Set a time frame
* Find valid resources
* Actually READ the documentation
* Type out almost everything    
* Choose what works for you, but think long term
* Think scalability
* Take notes and document everything (Why not?)
  * Find a style that works for you
  * Make sure the style is somewhat universal
  * Make sure the style is not an eyesore and is productive
* Own this project! 
* Have fun.
